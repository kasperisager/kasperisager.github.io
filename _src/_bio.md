I'm an enthusiastic front-end developer who spends his time cutting code at [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.com) in Montr√©al, Quebec. I'm a bit of a Javascript and CSS addict and love writing highly-maintainable and functional UI libraries, scaffolds and the likes.

When I'm not busy writing code, I usually kick back and strum some strings, watch a ridicouless cartoon, or listen to a killer track on Rdio. I'm also a big fan of falafel.
