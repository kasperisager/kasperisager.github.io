<p>I'm an enthusiastic front-end developer who spends his time building things at <a href="http://vanillaforums.com">Vanilla Forums</a> in Montr√©al, Quebec. I'm a bit of a Javascript and CSS addict and love writing highly-maintainable and functional UI libraries, scaffolds and the likes.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy writing code, I usually kick back and strum some strings, watch a ridiculous cartoon, or listen to a killer track on Rdio.</p>
