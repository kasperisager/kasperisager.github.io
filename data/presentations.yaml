- title: "Leveling up CSS"
  tagline: "Writing, scaling, and maintaining plain CSS codebases used to be a pain and pre-processors came along to save the day. Things are however moving fast and CSS is catching up with the pre-processors and is becoming increasingly expressive. This presentation introduces some of the new specifications in CSS and makes an argument against the pre-processors of today."
