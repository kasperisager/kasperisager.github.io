    During the development of Siteimprove UI, our internal library of reusable

    the things we found most useful.

- title: "Coding for Accessibility"
  tagline: |
    While it might come off as difficult, and certainly sometimes can be, coding
    for accessibility essentially boils down to two rather simple things: Mindset
    and semantics. This presentation gives a brief introduction to these two
    concepts and provides some practical advice on turning inaccessible UI
    accessible.

- title: "Leveling up CSS"
  tagline: |
    Writing, scaling, and maintaining plain CSS codebases used to be a pain and
    pre-processors came along to save the day. Things are however moving fast and
    CSS is catching up with the pre-processors and is becoming increasingly
    expressive. This presentation introduces some of the new specifications in
    CSS and makes an argument against the pre-processors of today.

- title: "Workflows for the Modern Web"
  tagline: |
    Writing JavaScript applications for the browser is often a chaotic and
    fragmented experience. With a vast selection of technology at our disposal,
    bringing it all together is often time consuming and prone to error. This
    presentation introduces many of the tools used in modern front-end
    development for improving the overall development experience.
